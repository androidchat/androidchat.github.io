# AndroidChat

AndroidChat is an open community with a Slack team open to everyone. A place where every developer, idealist, entrepreneur or geek is welcome to share their ideas, questions and successes. Everyone can submit a blog post to the website via Github because we know everyone sometimes has an idea for a blogpost, but can't keep the content flowing. We aim with the AndroidChat blog to enable these people to share their knowledge with the community.
